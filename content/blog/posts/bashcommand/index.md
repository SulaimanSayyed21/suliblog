# Essential Bash Commands

Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a powerful command-line shell commonly used in Linux and macOS systems. Below is a list of some of the most commonly used and useful Bash commands, along with explanations and examples.

## File and Directory Commands

### `cd`
```bash
cd [directory]
```
Changes the current working directory to the specified path.

- Example:
  ```bash
  cd /home/user/Documents
  ```

---

### `pwd`
```bash
pwd
```

---

### `mkdir`
```bash

```
Creates a new directory.

- Example:

---

### `ls`
```bash
ls [options] [directory]
```
Lists the contents of a directory. By default, it shows the files and subdirectories in the current directory.

- Options:
  - `-l`: Long format listing.
  - `-a`: Includes hidden files.

- Example:
  ```bash
  ls -la /home/user
  ```

---

### `rm`
```bash
rm [options] [file_or_directory]
```
Removes files or directories. Use with caution, as deleted files cannot be recovered.

- Options:
  - `-r`: Recursively delete a directory and its contents.
  - `-f`: Force deletion without confirmation.

- Example:
  ```bash
  rm -rf /home/user/old_projects
  ```

---

### `cp`
```bash
cp [source] [destination]
```
The `cp` command copies files or directories from one location to another.

#### Options:
- `-r`: Recursively copy directories and their contents.

#### Example:
- Copy a file:
  ```bash
  cp file.txt /home/user/backup/
  ```
- Copy a directory:
  ```bash
  cp -r /home/user/projects /home/user/backup/
  ```

---

### `mv`
```bash
mv [source] [destination]
```
The `mv` command moves files or directories to a new location or renames them.

#### Example:
- Move a file:
  ```bash
  mv file.txt /home/user/Documents/
  ```
- Rename a file:
  ```bash
  mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
  ```

---

### `touch`
```bash
touch [file_name]
```
The `touch` command creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.

#### Example:
```bash
touch newfile.txt
```

---

### `cat`
```bash
cat [file]
```
The `cat` command displays the contents of a file.

#### Example:
```bash
cat file.txt
```

---

## Output and Display Commands

### `echo`
```bash
echo [text]
```
The `echo` command prints the specified text to the terminal.

#### Example:
```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

#### Example: Using `echo` with Environment Variables

The `echo` command can be used to display the values of variables. For example:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

This prints the value of the `$PATH` environment variable, which specifies the directories the shell searches for executable files.

#### Explanation of `$PATH`
- `$PATH` is an **environment variable** containing a colon-separated list of directories.
- When you type a command, the shell looks in these directories to find the executable.
- You can view or modify it using:
  ```bash
  echo $PATH
  export PATH=$PATH:/new/directory
  ```
  ```


---

### `grep`

```bash
grep [pattern] [file]
```
The `grep` command searches for a specific pattern in a file and prints matching lines.

#### Example:
```bash
grep "error" log.txt
```

---

## System Management Commands

### `chmod`
```bash
chmod [permissions] [file]
```
The `chmod` command changes the permissions of a file or directory.

#### Example:
```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
```

---

### `man`
```bash
man [command]
```
The `man` command displays the manual page for a specified command, providing detailed information.

#### Example:
```bash
man ls
```

---

### `exit`
```bash
exit
```
The `exit` command closes the current terminal session.

---

### `clear`
```bash
clear
```
The `clear` command clears the terminal screen, making it easier to view the next set of outputs.



## The `.bashrc` File

The `.bashrc` file is a shell script that runs whenever a new terminal session is started in interactive mode. It is commonly used to customize your shell environment by:

- Defining aliases.
- Setting environment variables.
- Modifying the `$PATH`.
- Adding custom functions.

To edit your `.bashrc` file, use:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
code .bashrc
```

After making changes, reload the file to apply them:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide

### Cleaning Up Log Files

Below is an example script named `cleanup` that clears the log files in the `/var/log` directory. This script must be run as the root user to have the necessary permissions.

#### **Script: `cleanup`**
```bash
# Cleanup
# Run as root, of course.

cd /var/log
cat /dev/null > messages
cat /dev/null > wtmp
echo "Log files cleaned up."
```

#### **Explanation**
1. **`cd /var/log`**: Changes the working directory to `/var/log`, where system log files are typically stored.
2. **`cat /dev/null > messages`**: Empties the `messages` log file by redirecting the output of `/dev/null` (an empty data source) to the file.
3. **`cat /dev/null > wtmp`**: Empties the `wtmp` file, which tracks user logins.
4. **`echo "Log files cleaned up."`**: Prints a confirmation message after cleaning up the log files.

#### **Usage**
1. Save the script as `cleanup` in an appropriate location (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/`).
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x cleanup
   ```
3. Run the script with root privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo ./cleanup
   ```

---

#### **Important Notes**
- This script permanently clears the content of the specified log files. Ensure you back up any necessary logs before running it.
- You can customize the script to include additional log files or directories as needed.
