### What is Software Engineering?

**Software engineering** is a systematic approach to the design and development of software.

*Systematic approach:* an organized, structured process often broken down into clear steps such as planning, designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software.

##### Responsibilities of a Software Engineer
- Designing, building, and maintaining software systems
- Writing and testing code
- Consulting with stakeholders, third-party vendors, security specialists, and other team members

##### Software Engineer vs. Software Developer
Software engineers build entire systems, while software developers focus on implementing specific functionalities within those systems.

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** provides a systematic process for software development. It was originally developed in the 1960s and 1970s to address the increasing complexity of software and the need for an organized approach.

##### Key Advantages of SDLC
- Offers a structured roadmap for the software development process, reducing risk and enhancing efficiency
- Improves communication between team members and stakeholders
- Clearly defines roles and responsibilities for each team member
- Supports iterative development, allowing adaptation to changing requirements


### Phases of the SDLC

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) can be divided into six phases:

1. **Planning**: Involves gathering requirements and developing the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
2. **Design**: Architecture and design documents are created to outline the systemâ€™s structure.
3. **Development**: The coding phase, where the software is built.
4. **Testing**: Test the application to ensure it is stable and meets requirements. Bugs are identified and fixed.
5. **Deployment**: The code is released to the production environment.
6. **Maintenance**: Stakeholder feedback is gathered, issues and bugs are identified, and code enhancements are suggested.

This information can then be fed into a new development cycle if necessary.

#### Software Development Methodologies

Three common approaches to software development are the **Waterfall**, **V-Model**, and **Agile** methodologies.

- **Waterfall** and **V-Model** are sequential approaches, while **Agile** is iterative (repetitive).
- Waterfall and V-Model are straightforward and easy to use, but they do not accommodate changing requirements well.
- Agile allows for adapting to changing requirements, though it can be challenging to manage time and team workload effectively.
