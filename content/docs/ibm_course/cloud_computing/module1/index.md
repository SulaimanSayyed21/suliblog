### **Introduction to Cloud Computing**
- **Definition by NIST**: A model for convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (networks, servers, storage, applications, services) that can be provisioned and released with minimal management effort.
  
#### **Key Benefits**
- **Flexibility**:
  - Users can customize and access applications from anywhere with an internet connection.
  - Rapid provisioning of additional resources to meet spikes in demand.
- **Efficiency**:
  - Efficient marketing and deployment of applications without high maintenance or IT infrastructure costs.
  - Business-friendly utility model: Pay only for the resources used.

#### **Characteristics of Cloud Computing**  
1. **On-demand self-service**:
   - Resources available 24/7.
   - Examples: ATMs, vending machines that operate without downtime.
2. **Broad network access**:
   - Access via a wide range of devices (e.g., tablets, smartphones, wearables) with internet connectivity.
   - Public clouds need internet; private clouds may work over intranet networks.
3. **Resource pooling**:
   - Multi-tenant model: Shared resources dynamically allocated among users.
   - Provides cost savings due to economies of scale.
4. **Rapid elasticity**:
   - Vertical and horizontal scaling to accommodate changing workloads.
