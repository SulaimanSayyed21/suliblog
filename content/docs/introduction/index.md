## Greeting

I'm Sulaiman Sayyed, an aspiring full stack software developer passionate about learning, sharing, and building innovative solutions. With a background in web development and a growing expertise in programming, I'm diving into the IBM Full Stack Software Developer course to expand my skills and bring value to the tech community. Through this website, I’ll be sharing insights, tutorials, and project updates as I progress in my journey. 

### What is Software Engineering?

**Software engineering** is a systematic approach to the design and development of software.

*Systematic approach:* an organized, structured process often broken down into clear steps such as planning, designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software.

##### Responsibilities of a Software Engineer
- Designing, building, and maintaining software systems
- Writing and testing code
- Consulting with stakeholders, third-party vendors, security specialists, and other team members

##### Software Engineer vs. Software Developer
Software engineers build entire systems, while software developers focus on implementing specific functionalities within those systems.

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** provides a systematic process for software development. It was originally developed in the 1960s and 1970s to address the increasing complexity of software and the need for an organized approach.

##### Key Advantages of SDLC
- Offers a structured roadmap for the software development process, reducing risk and enhancing efficiency
- Improves communication between team members and stakeholders
- Clearly defines roles and responsibilities for each team member
- Supports iterative development, allowing adaptation to changing requirements


### Phases of the SDLC

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) can be divided into six phases:

1. **Planning**: Involves gathering requirements and developing the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
2. **Design**: Architecture and design documents are created to outline the system’s structure.
3. **Development**: The coding phase, where the software is built.
4. **Testing**: Test the application to ensure it is stable and meets requirements. Bugs are identified and fixed.
5. **Deployment**: The code is released to the production environment.
6. **Maintenance**: Stakeholder feedback is gathered, issues and bugs are identified, and code enhancements are suggested.

This information can then be fed into a new development cycle if necessary.

#### Software Development Methodologies

Three common approaches to software development are the **Waterfall**, **V-Model**, and **Agile** methodologies.

- **Waterfall** and **V-Model** are sequential approaches, while **Agile** is iterative (repetitive).
- Waterfall and V-Model are straightforward and easy to use, but they do not accommodate changing requirements well.
- Agile allows for adapting to changing requirements, though it can be challenging to manage time and team workload effectively.
